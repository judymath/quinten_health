Yet after only 2 infusions on Inflectra I have multiple daily loose stools regardless of healthy diet, as well as bloody stools at least once a day.  In addition to Inflectra not preventing flare ups, inflammation, and symptoms; Inflectra has incurred more issues that I didn't have previously:
Kidney pain

I said I really didn't want to go through that again. The specialist would not leave it alone. I Mentioned Covid-19 to him and he said it won't make a difference if I am off remicade or not. Oh okay, I guess all these tests were for nothing then? Now I am without a specialist. He then talked down about me to my family doctor saying I am refusing treatment.

I believe my Crohn's was triggered or worsened by a doctor misdiagnosing my lower back/hip joint pain from Crohn's and prescribing heavy Ibuprofen. I tried Asacol, Imuran, and Pentasa, but always ended up taking prednisone to calm the symptoms. Every February I ended up with flare-ups. Doctor put me on Remicade 4 years ago and other than some swelling up in the hands initially and getting perma-colds occasionally, it has worked very well.

I was diagnosed with Crohn's the year before, and nothing had worked - asacol, prednisone, imuran.  Then Remicade was a LIFESAVER! I actually could live my life like a normal person again! I had a hard time scheduling my infusions because I was in college, so my advice would be to get it as close to your due date (7 weeks, 8 weeks, etc) as you can so you can get ahead of the flare. I've noticed that if I get my remicade late, I feel pretty terrible until my next dose. I've never gotten sick or had an allergic reaction from it, and I've been on it for 15 years. It's not working as well as it once did, so I'm hoping I can change to a shot so I don't have to sit through an infusion. If you're considering going on Remicade, I highly recommend it. It helped me live a semi-normal life. However, I did develop psoriasis about 10 years ago. I'd happily take psoriasis if it means I can be on Remicade.

Former G.I. was hesitant to use biologics but I really was ready to try something new.  
I have had three induction I.V.s.  The I.V. is very easy.  I live close to the doctor's office and I am in and out less than 35 minutes. The only possible side effects are a scratchy throat and some mild itchy skin.  Both of these things could be unrelated.

Testing showed that at 4 weeks the level of ENTYVIO in my system was far below the recommended level. I hope that it continues to work for me. I started on Remicade in 2005 when I was diagnosed with U. C. I was on it a few years but ended up failing completely to help symptoms. I was then put on Cimzia which I did not respond to at all. I then was put on Humira. I was on it till 2010 when thyroid cancer was found. After thyroid was removed I was put on ENTYVIO. Due to the cancer I can't have imuno modifier medications.

Later in the year I was diagnosed with PSC (Primary sclerosing cholangitis ) a form of liver disease. Likewise there are lots of horrible side effects like sore throat, fatigue, increased joint pains, etc. Due to the weakened immune system I also got a bunch of infections, especially in hair follicles which caused severe itchiness. I also got a heart infection (pericarditis), two lots of pneumonia and an opportunistic lung infection that forced me to permanently cease use of the drug. My consultant told me if I remained on it I would die. So all of these infections are all pretty serious and life threatening. Only take this drug if you are desperate and have no other options.

542,For Ulcerative Colitis,6.0,"Started this drug vedolizumab in June 2020 after being hospitalised due to bad flare up of Ulcrative Colitis. Was put on 40mg pred and had first vedolizumab infusion.
Came off steroids in August 20 and have been steroid free. My symptoms have improved a lot, I just get abdominal pains which I can manage. However the side effects on vedolizumab have been pretty bad, at first I had really bad join pains especially in my ankles/wrist and back, then the fatigue was really bad, still feel very tired, I have good days and bad ones. Also get random attacks of cold and runny nose. I also get strange chest tightness, had CT and x ray all fine so can only assume side effect of vedolizumab.

Although vedolizumab has helped my UC a lot, the side effects have been pretty awful. I'm just doing my best to stick it out in the hope that the side effects will wear off with time. 

My advice give it a try if nothing else has worked.",, Ulcerative Colitis

I wasn't too concerned about it at first because I used to have to get my hair thinned because I had so much hair. I stopped Entyvio 3 months ago and my hair is still thinner than it used to be and I am still shedding probably more than the average person but not nearly as bad as when I was on it. I could put my hands through my hair and see so much falling out. Entyvio stays in your system for at least a month after your last dose so I'm hoping my hair will become healthier again. I'm on Humira now so hopefully it doesn't cause it too but it's gotten MUCH BETTER being on Humira. Also Entyvio didn't work for me for UC, it only has a 40% success rate.

I experienced a decrease in abdominal cramping immediately after the initial treatment but the other symptoms persisted. At the 6 week mark all my Crohns symptoms decreased significantly. My appetite is back and I am putting on some weight, and I am having normal bowel movements. My chronic eye inflammation has also significantly decreased which makes me suspect that it is indeed Crohns related. I am only in the beginning stages of treatment but the impressive results makes me so hopeful and honestly has made me forget that I had Crohn's to begin with.

Two years on Stelara and I have my life back. I also changed my diet to the Mediteranean, avoiding simple sugars and eating only healthy food. Changing the gut microbiome along with finding the right medicine is key to controlling Crohn's. Much research now is pointing to the role of healthy gut microbiota.

Now one year after initial IV infusion...much better results...almost too good. Constipation is my norm. Painful gas constantly...bloating..exhaustion...and a simple head cold took forever to leave.

This was all over a year and a half. I was starting to come to the realization that surgery was my only option. Then my Gastroenterolgist suggested Stelara which although known to be treated for rheumatoid arthritis, recent studies have shown success with ulcerative colitis. After my first treatment, I started seeing my symptoms improving. After my second treatment I was seeing drastic changes to point where my bowel movements were down to 2-3x per day, down from 10-15.
